## Using the Package

The `ces package` provides access to the 2019 CES Online Survey and 2019 Phone Survey by loading in both survey datasets under the names `ces2019_web` and `ces2019_phone` respectively. The datasets have not automatically been assigned to variable names to avoid possible confusion with other variable names.

To call either dataset, assign the desired dataset a variable name, e.g.
```
ces2019_web <- ces2019_web
ces2019_phone <- ces2019_phone
```

Alternatively, specific variables can be accessed without having to assign the whole dataset via the format datasetname$variablename, e.g. 
```
ces2019_web$cps19_imp_iss_party
```

The `ces package` also provides a non-exhuastive dataset consisting of 21 variables with renamed columns under the name `decon`.
The variables in this dataset have been converted to factors so that they display the actual values of the survey responses
and not just the survey code responses.

The `decon` dataset consists of the following variables:
* citzenship: Canadian citizenship status
* yob: year of birth 
* gender: identified gender of the respondent
* province_territory: Province or Territory of current residence
* education: highest level of education completed
* lr: united column of lr_bef and lr_aft values; whether the respondent identifies on the political spectrum
* lr_bef: where the respodent identifies on the political spectrum; asked before party identification questions
* lr_aft: where the respondent identifies on the political spectrum; asked after party identification questions
* religion: religion of respondent
* sexuality: sexual identity
* sexuality_other: sexual identity; written answers
* language_eng: language learned as child and still understand; selected response English
* language_fr: language learned as a child and still understand; selected response French
* language_abgl: langauge learned as a child and still understand; specified Aboriginal language
* employment: employment status
* income: total household income, before taxes, for the year 2018
* income_cat: selected household income category
* marital: marital status
* econ_retro: response to question, 'over the past year, has Canada's economy:'
* econ_fed: response to question, 'have the policies of the federal government made Canada's economy...'
* econ_self: response to question, have the policies of the federal government made your financial situation...'

The `decon` dataset can be called by assigning it to a variable name, e.g.
```
decon <- decon
```

Alternatively, a specific variable can be called without assigning the whole dataset with the format datasetname$variablename, e.g.
```
decon$education
```
