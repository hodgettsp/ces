#' Produces a non-exhaustive dataframe of 21 variables with renamed columns
#' NAs have not been removed, birth year (yob) has been recoded from the survey code to the actual year.
#' Other variables have not been recoded so as to not interfere with languages.
#' The politically left/right question variables (lr_bef and lr_aft) have also been provided in one column together under the name lr.
#' Variables are citizenship, yob (year of birth), gender, province_territory, education, lr, lr_bef, lr_aft,
#' religion, sexuality, sexuality_other (written answers), language_eng (English language speakers),
#' language_fr (French language speakers), language_abgl (Aboriginal language speakers), employment,
#' income, income cat (category), marital, econ_retro (past economic effects), econ_fed (effect of federal policies),
#' and econ_self (personal economic situation)
